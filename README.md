# python-data-science-handbook-in-clojure

These notes reproduce parts of the (MIT-licensed) [code](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) of the [Python Data Science Notebook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas.

We will add our own text, clarifying the Clojure code and the methods behind it. Eventually, the resulting resource should serve as a self-contained tutorial.

## Rendered book

## Tooling
We use the [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/) convention and render the notes sing [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Contributions are welcome, with some coordination regarding the choice of chapters, the style, etc.. A contribution guide will be added soon.

## Previous work
The [scicloj-data-science-handbook](https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj-data-science-handbook) was a previous attempt to translate parts of the book and add some original chapters. A few community members have done some tremendous work there. We will possibly adopt some parts, with the permission of the people who wrote them.
